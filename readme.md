## NYC Concert List

Hi, welcome to my README for my NYC current concert search web app integrating Google Maps and SongKick API's

###Part 1: How to run the app

Download the repository to your computer. Launch the index.html file in your browser. Enjoy!

###Part 2: How to use the app

The app loads current concert information with locations for concerts in NYC.

1. List View
  To see the concerts listed out click the list button. It will open a scrollable dropdown list.

2. Search
  You can search the results using the search window. This will update the map and the list. If you want to go back
  to the original results either search for all, or hit enter with nothing typed in the search bar.

3. More info
  Inside each infowindow at the concert marker you can click the more info link to go to the relevant SongKick page.
  There you can find out about tickets, as well as more in-depth info on the event.
